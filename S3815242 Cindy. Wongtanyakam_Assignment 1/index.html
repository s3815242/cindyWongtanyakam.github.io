                    <h5>- Maybe the webpage could have more media rather that using 100% interacting style for the session.
                        Video, background sound could help us to relax even more.
                    </h5>

                    <img src="IMG/Atmosphere2.png" width="550" height="300">

                    <!--Q15-->
                    <h4>What makes it frustrating?</h4>
                    <h5>- They are the backgroung that graphing will replete itself as we drug the cursor around the webpage. I think the ralaxation can be a minimal design rather than is repleting coloutful graphic.</h5>

                    <!--Q16-->
                    <h4>16) Why do you think they designed the interaction in this way?</h4>
                    <h5>- Maybe the designer wanted the user to pay attention on every movement of ourselves.</h5>

                    <!--Q17-->
                    <h4>17) What is an alternative approach to the interaction design of this element?</h4>
                    <h5>- I think we can using  a repleting style to present the interaction. But the might chage the sizes and colours of those shape. To make it looks more clean and minimise.</h5>

                    <!--Q18-->
                    <h4>What is the most satisfying element of the interaction?</h4>
                    <h5>- Colour palate and interaction design that existed in the design. The way that the interact design is presenting. And I can take a time to relax as I need to read an article on each pop-up pages.</h5>

                    <!--Q19-->
                    <h4>19) What makes it satisfying?</h4>
                    <h5>- The design matched with the purpose of thr website. Using cool tone, elements and colours.</h5>

                    <!--Q20-->
                    <h4>20) Why do you think they designed the interaction in this way?</h4>
                    <h5>- Because the purpose of the website is an online spa. And the design has a complex link to direct to multiple windows. So, it makes user to take an attention on the design. We need to read and play trough the difference windows. I think it is another way to take my time to relaxing using online platform.</h5>

                    <!--Q21-->
                    <h4>21) What is an alternative approach to the interaction design of this element?</h4>
                    <h5>- I might creates more way of interacting on the websote. As this one is mostly like the user needs to close all the pop-up windows.
                        But we can also add a sesstion like have a graphic of image of head massage. And user can follow all the steps. And I will put a sound music as a soundtrack during the online session.
